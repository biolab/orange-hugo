      <description>In this workflow we explore story arcs in the Little Match Seller story. First we select the story from the corpus of Andersen tales. Then we create a table, where each sentence of the tale is a separate row. We use sentiment analysis to compute the sentiment of each sentence, then observe the emotional arcs through the story. We also inspect sentences with similar scores in the Heat Map and Corpus Viewer.</description>

      <description>2020 - Year in Code 2020 is coming a to close. This year had its share of challenges, but we are among the lucky ones being able to work from home. Of course, some of us had to manage being a parent and a developer at the same time, but for the most part, we were successful. We&amp;rsquo;ve managed to write a couple of new widgets, solve issues, implement enhancement, wrote documentation, and tried to keep the Orange community alive and kicking.</description>
