      <description>We all know each profession has its own jargon. Most of us remember from any hospital series something like: &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;Pass me the scalpel, stat!&amp;rdquo; Meaning &amp;ldquo;give me the scalpel quickly&amp;rdquo;.
Data scientists are no different. We have our own terminology that requires some getting used to. Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of common terms that we use in machine learning. Some terms are specific to Orange and might not be used elsewhere. The post is intended to get you familiar with concepts used in Orange.</description>

      <description>A year ago, we put out a survey asking the Orange community if they use Orange for teaching (or learning) and at which educational institution. We got around 300 replies from 200 universities in the first round.
In the past year, we were starting to establish a global community of educators that teach statistics, data mining, and machine learning (or perhaps something entirely different) and are using Orange for this purpose.</description>

      <description>Orange in Classroom About three weeks ago, we put out a short survey asking professors, teaching assistants, and students to tell us how they use Orange in class. We have gotten four-hundred responses, and it turns out that over two hundred universities from around the world actively use Orange in the classroom.
We sincerely thank everyone for the answers!
 Here is a a list of universities, in alphabetical order, we have compiled from the survey.</description>
