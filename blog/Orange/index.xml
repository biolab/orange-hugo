      <description>Orange in Classroom About three weeks ago, we put out a short survey asking professors, teaching assistants, and students to tell us how they use Orange in class. We have gotten four-hundred responses, and it turns out that over two hundred universities from around the world actively use Orange in the classroom.
We sincerely thank everyone for the answers!
