      <description>There are many ways to cluster the data in Orange. Hiearchical clustering, k-means, and DBSCAN are just few of the widgets we can use to find groups of data instances with similar values of attributes. Once we infer the clusters, we need to analyze them to determine their characterizing features. It is there that actually the fun begins.
 Out of many ways for cluster analysis, perhaps the simplest one is by using the Box Plot.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing more beautiful than seeing your data in plot. Preferably one that exposes interesting properties of the data or relationships between data instances. We recently wrote about embeddings and dimensionality reduction techniques, but now we are back to basics - whisker plots, means, medians, and distributions.

Most of you will be familiar with a good ol&#39; box plot, also called whisker plot. The visualization shows essential data properties - mean, median, interquartile range, and variance.</description>
