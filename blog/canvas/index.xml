      <description>This is a long story. I remember when started my PhD in Italy. There I met a researcher and he said to me: »You should do some simulations on x-ray optics beamline.« »Yes, but how should I do that?« He gave me a big tape, it was 1986. I soon realized it was all code. But it was a code called Shadow.
I started to look at the code, to play with it, do some simulations… Soon my boss told me:</description>
