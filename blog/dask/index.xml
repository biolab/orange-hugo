Or, more precisely, into an experimental version of Orange that supports Dask.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve already set up your data as an Orange Table and you would just like to re-encode it to better support dask, then all you have to do is export it again as a .</description></item><item><title>A dash of Dask</title><link>/blog/2023/2023-08-31-a-dash-of-dask/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/2023-08-31-a-dash-of-dask/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since our last progress update onÂ Dask, and quite a bit has happened since. Most noticeably, we&amp;rsquo;ve got some more visualization widgets working, but I leave that for another blog post. Today, I want to focus on our updated machine-learning methods. K-Means, PCA, Naive Bayes, Linear, and Logistic Regression are now running. Well, maybe not flawlessly, but hey, they work.
Currently, most of Orange&amp;rsquo;s learners wrap existing scikit-learn methods.</description></item><item><title>Orange you going to ask about dask?</title><link>/blog/2022/2022-12-13-dask-table/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/2022-12-13-dask-table/</guid><description>As great as Orange is at simplifying machine learning and bringing it closer to your everyday regular normal guy, it turns out, there are some major drawbacks that stem from it&amp;rsquo;s very inception. This is because Orange is meant to be run on a laptop. A device with just a handful of CPU cores, and maybe a couple of gigabytes of RAM. Due to this ideology we have so far reasoned that nobody in their right mind would want to throw a very large dataset at it.</description></item></channel></rss>
