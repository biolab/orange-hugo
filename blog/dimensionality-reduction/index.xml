      <description>I recently enjoy studying and showing differences between t-SNE and other data embedding and projection techniques. In particular, in some recent hands-on courses, we often introduce data visualization by principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, and t-SNE. We would start with the zoo data set, where the data set is smaller, and the difference are less pronounced. We then traverse through employee attrition data set with exciting clusters exposed in t-SNE. To finish, and especially for the academic audience, we then show and compare the three different dimensionality reduction techniques on data from single-cell gene expression data.</description>
