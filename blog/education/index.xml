      <description>PLOS Computation Biology has just published our paper on training about overfitting:
 Demšar J, Zupan B (2021) Hands-on training about overfitting. PLoS Comput Biol 17(3): e1008671.  Machine learning has recently propelled approaches for the analysis of data, but &amp;ldquo;for the uninitiated, the technology poses significant difficulties&amp;rdquo; (Deep learning for biology, Nature, Feb 22, 2018). One of the hard concepts for starters in machine learning is overfitting. Overfitting can lead to models that include patterns that do not generalize well and could be meaningless.</description>

      <description>Orange in Classroom About three weeks ago, we put out a short survey asking professors, teaching assistants, and students to tell us how they use Orange in class. We have gotten four-hundred responses, and it turns out that over two hundred universities from around the world actively use Orange in the classroom.
We sincerely thank everyone for the answers!
 Here is a a list of universities, in alphabetical order, we have compiled from the survey.</description>

      <description>We just finished a lecture and a student came with a question. The lecture was, in short, about how predictive models compute probabilities; to use a model for making decisions, we must find a threshold that will minimize the cost, maximize the profit, strike a good balance between sensitivity and specificity, or increase the general human well-being in some other way. So this student came with a question about something I didn&amp;rsquo;t explain well, and she gave me one last chance.</description>

      <description>Our entry to this year&amp;rsquo;s largest bioinformatics conference was on the training of single-cell data analytics. We claim that with Orange and its new single-cell RNA analysis add-on, one can assemble a workshop to teach essential concepts from single-cell analytics in a single day.
 \
Single-cell genomics is driven on revolutionary technology from molecular biology that allows us to peek into inner workings of the individual cell. Single-cell datasets feature thousands of genes and cells and benefit from the analysis that integrates this data with other knowledge sources, like those on the classification of genes, lists of pathways, and sets of cell-type markers.</description>

      <description>On Monday we finished the second part of the workshop for the Statistical Office of Republic of Slovenia. The crowd was tough - these guys knew their numbers and asked many challenging questions. And we loved it!
One thing we discussed was how to properly test your model. Ok, we know never to test on the same data you&amp;rsquo;ve built your model with, but even training and testing on separate data is sometimes not enough.</description>

      <description>How do you explain text mining in 3 hours? Is it even possible? Can someone be ready to build predictive models and perform clustering in a single afternoon?
It seems so, especially when Orange is involved.
Yesterday, on August 7, we held a 3-hour workshop on text mining and text analysis for a large crowd of esteemed researchers at Digital Humanities 2017 in Montreal, Canada. Surely, after 3 hours everyone was exhausted, both the audience and the lecturers.</description>

      <description>February was a month of Orange workshops.
Ljubljana: Biologists We (Tomaž, Martin and I) have started in Ljubljana with a hands-on course for the COST Action FA1405 Systems Biology Training School. This was a four hour workshop with an introduction to classification and clustering, and then with application of machine learning to analysis of gene expression data on a plant called Arabidopsis. The organization of this course has even inspired us for a creation of a new widget GOMapMan Ontology that was added to Bioinformatics add-on.</description>

The project brought together pupils and students from around the country and hopefully showed them what computer science is mostly about. Most children would think programming is just typing lines of code. But it&amp;rsquo;s more than that. It&amp;rsquo;s a way of thinking, a way to solve problems creatively and efficiently.</description>

      <description>TIP #1: Follow tutorials and example workflows to get started.
It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to start using new software. Where does one start, especially a total novice in data mining? For this exact reason we&amp;rsquo;ve prepared Getting Started With Orange - YouTube tutorials for complete beginners. Example workflows on the other hand can be accessed via Help - Examples.
TIP #2: Make use of Orange documentation.

      <description>This is a guest blog from the Google Summer of Code project.
Gradient Descent was implemented as a part of my Google Summer of Code project and it is available in the Orange3-Educational add-on. It simulates gradient descent for either Logistic or Linear regression, depending on the type of the input data. Gradient descent is iterative approach to optimize model parameters that minimize the cost function. In machine learning, the cost function corresponds to prediction error when the model is used on the training data set.</description>

      <description>This is a guest blog from the Google Summer of Code project.
As a part of my Google Summer of Code project I started developing educational widgets and assemble them in an Educational Add-On for Orange. Educational widgets can be used by students to understand how some key data mining algorithms work and by teachers to demonstrate the working of these algorithms.
Here I describe an educational widget for interactive k-means clustering, an algorithm that splits the data into clusters by finding cluster centroids such that the distance between data points and their corresponding centroid is minimized.</description>

      <description>One of the key techniques of exploratory data mining is clustering – separating instances into distinct groups based on some measure of similarity. We can estimate the similarity between two data instances through euclidean (pythagorean), manhattan (sum of absolute differences between coordinates) and mahalanobis distance (distance from the mean by standard deviation), or, say, through Pearson correlation or Spearman correlation.
Our main goal when clustering data is to get groups of data instances where:</description>

      <description>We have just completed an Introduction to Data Mining, a graduate course at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, Houston. The course was given in September and consisted of seven two-hour lectures, each one followed with a homework assignment. The course was attended by about 40 students and some faculty and research staff.
This was a challenging course. The audience was new to data mining, and we decided to teach them with the newest, third version of Orange.</description>

      <description>Biolab is currently hosting two amazing data scientists from the Tilburg University - dr. Marie Nilsen and dr. Eric Postma, who are preparing a 20-lecture MOOC on data science for non-technical audience. A part of the course will use Orange. The majority of their students is coming from humanities, law, economy and behavioral studies, thus we are discussing options and opportunities for adapting Orange for social scientists. Another great thing is that the course is designed for beginner level data miners, showcasing that anybody can mine the data and learn from it.</description>
