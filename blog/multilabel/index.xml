      <description>The last summer, student Wencan Luo participated in Google Summer of Code to implement Multi-label Classification in Orange. He provided a framework, implemented a few algorithms and some prototype widgets. His work has been &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo; in our repositories for too long; finally, we have merged part of his code into Orange (widgets are not there yet &amp;hellip;) and added a more general support for multi-target prediction.

      <description>Traditional single-label classification is concerned with learning from a set of examples that are associated with a single label l from a set of disjoint labels L, |L| &amp;gt; 1. If |L| = 2, then the learning problem is called a binary classification problem, while if |L| &amp;gt; 2, then it is called a multi-class classification problem (Tsoumakas &amp;amp; Katakis, 2007).
Multi-label classification methods are increasingly used by many applications, such as textual data classification, protein function classification, music categorization and semantic scene classification.</description>

      <description>Multi-label classification is one of the three projects of Google Summer Code 2011 for Orange. The main goal is to extend the Orange to support multi-label, including dataset support, two basic multi-label classifications-problem-transformation methods &amp;amp; algorithm adaptation methods, evaluation measures, GUI support, documentation, testing, and so on.
My name is Wencan Luo, from China. I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to work with my mentor Matija. Until now, we have finished a framework for multi-label support for Orange.</description>
