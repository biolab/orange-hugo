      <description>2020 - Year in Code 2020 is coming a to close. This year had its share of challenges, but we are among the lucky ones being able to work from home. Of course, some of us had to manage being a parent and a developer at the same time, but for the most part, we were successful. We&amp;rsquo;ve managed to write a couple of new widgets, solve issues, implement enhancement, wrote documentation, and tried to keep the Orange community alive and kicking.</description>
