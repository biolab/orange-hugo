      <description>Have you ever tried Orange with data big enough that some widgets ran for more than a second? Then you have seen it: Orange froze. While the widget was processing, the interface would not respond to any inputs, and there was no way to stop that widget.
Not all the widgets freeze, though! Some widgets, like Test &amp;amp; Score, k-Means, or Image Embedding, do not block. While they are working, we are free to build other parts of the workflow, and these widgets also show their progress.</description>

      <description>Orange has been loading data faster since the end of February, especially if there are many attributes in the file.
Quick comparisons between the old new versions, measured on my computer:
 adult.tab (32561 examples, 15 attributes): old version = 1.41s, new version = 0.86s. DLBCL.tab (77 examples, 7071 attributes): old version = 2.72s, new version = 0.93s. GDS1962.tab (104 examples, 31837 attributes): old version = 33.5s, new version = 6.</description>
