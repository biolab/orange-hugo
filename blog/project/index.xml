      <description>We have successfully launched a new project about AI and data science in elementary and high schools.
AI is the technology of the century, yet too few kids and education professionals know about its concepts, ideas and applications. The project, funded by Google.org and Tides Foundation, is aimed at bringing AI to teachers and kids by designing hands-on workshops by focusing on conceptual learning and applications.
During the course of the project, between January 31st 2022 and July 31st 2023, we expect to carry out several activities whose long term outcome is expected to improve overall education about AI in Slovenia.</description>

      <description>Recently, we have attended an xAIM project meeting in Hannover, Germany. xAIM is an EU project whose aim is to develop a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree tailored to the medical professionals or those wanting to work in the medical field. The focus of the MA is on explainable artificial intelligence, that is on the explanation of machine learning models, ethical aspects of AI, and the translation of models into the medical setting.</description>
