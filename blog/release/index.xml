      <description>Every week on Friday, when the core team of Orange developers meets, we are designing new improvements of Orange&amp;rsquo;s graphical interface. This time, it was the status bar. Well, actually, it was the status bar quite a while ago and required the change of the core widget library, but it is materializing these days and you will see the changes in the next release.
Consider the Neighbors widget. The widget considers the input data and reference data items, and outputs instance form input data that are most similar to the references.</description>

Some of you might have an issue installing add-ons with the following issue popping up:

This is the result of the migration to a new infrastructure at PyPi, which provides the installation of add-ons. Our team has rallied to adjust the add-on installer so it works with the new and improved service.
In order to make the add-on installer work (again), please download the latest version of Orange (3.</description>

Recently, we&amp;rsquo;ve released Orange version 3.4.5 and Orange3-Text version 0.2.5. We focused on the Text add-on since we are lately holding a lot of text mining workshops. The next one will be at Digital Humanities 2017 in Montreal, QC, Canada in a couple of days and we simply could not resist introducing some sexy new features_._
