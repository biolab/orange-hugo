We also demonstrated how to use them to detect bias in a dataset and visualized the results for a better understanding. In this blog, we will introduce the Reweighing widget, which we can use to mitigate bias in a dataset, resulting in fairer machine learning models learning from it.
Reweighing: The Reweighing widget offers a solution to mitigate bias in datasets by assigning weights to individual instances.</description></item><item><title>Orange Fairness - Reweighing as a preprocessor</title><link>/blog/2023/2023-09-19-fairness-reweighing-preprocessor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/2023-09-19-fairness-reweighing-preprocessor/</guid><description>In the previous blog post, we introduced the Orange fairness Reweighing widget and used it to reweigh a dataset. In this blog, we will explore another use case for the Reweighing widget: using it as a preprocessor for a specific model.
Fairness metrics: With the fairness addon and widgets that come with it, we also introduced four bias scoring metrics which we can use to evaluate the fairness of model predictions.</description></item></channel></rss>
