      <title>Confusion matrix for regression?</title>

      <description>It is easy to inspect misclassifications in the Confusion Matrix widget when building classification models. One can even click on misclassified instances, output them and observe them in various visualizations. But what about regression? Predicting numeric values doesn&amp;rsquo;t even allow connecting Confusion Matrix, nor would it make sense. So how can one inspect prediction error for regression tasks?
Let us take the well-known housing data set from the File widget. The dataset has 506 instances of houses described with 13 variables and a regression target variable MEDV (median value of homes in 1000$).</description>

      <description>Orange has a wide array of visualizations, which enable exploring the data from different perspectives. But each visualization is unique - it is used for a specific purpose, which is closely related to how one interprets the plot. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the most common visualizations in Orange, when to use them and how to read them. We will use the heart_disease.tab data set from the File widget in the next examples.</description>

      <description>Scatter plots are surely one of the best loved visualizations in Orange. Very often, when we teach, people go back to scatter plots over and over again to see their data. We took peopleâ€™s love for scatter plots to the heart and we redesigned them a bit to make them even more friendly.
Our favorite still remains the Informative Projections button. This button helps you find interesting visualizations from all the combinations of your data variables.</description>
