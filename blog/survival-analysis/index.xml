      <description>In our previous blog post, we discussed the basic concepts of survival analysis, the types of problems it aims to solve and briefly introduced the Kaplan-Meier method. We used the Kaplan-Meier widget to estimate a population&amp;rsquo;s survival probability over time, taking into account a specific covariate. However, we did not account for the impact of other covariates on the survival outcome.
When studying patient outcomes in clinical settings, it is essential to consider multiple factors that describe patients&#39; conditions and may affect survival.</description>

      <title>An introduction to the Kaplan-Meier Estimator</title>

      <description>The Kaplan-Meier Estimator is a function that relates time to the probability of an event of interest. It is widely used in survival analysis and with the addition of the Survival Analysis package to Orange it is now readily available for accessible visual analytics. However, any kind of efficient data analysis requires a basic understanding of what the implemented model does. This blog post thus aims to:
 explain the most important concepts needed for understanding the Kaplan-Meier Estimator, show how to manually calculate and interpret a survival curve to build an intuitive understanding and show how this can be implemented in Orange with a few clicks.</description>
