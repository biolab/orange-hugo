      <description>The Timeseries add-on has been on a backlog for quite some time now. Mostly because a bulk of its visualizations have been written in Highcharts, a visualization library built on JavaScript. We&amp;rsquo;re Python developers, so none of us felt comfortable touching anything JS. Moreover, Highcharts is not fully open source, so licensing is a potential issue for certain Orange users.
There was only one person who could (and would) tackle this - our senior developer Vesna.</description>
