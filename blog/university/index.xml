      <description>A year ago, we put out a survey asking the Orange community if they use Orange for teaching (or learning) and at which educational institution. We got around 300 replies from 200 universities in the first round.

      <description>Orange in Classroom About three weeks ago, we put out a short survey asking professors, teaching assistants, and students to tell us how they use Orange in class. We have gotten four-hundred responses, and it turns out that over two hundred universities from around the world actively use Orange in the classroom.
We sincerely thank everyone for the answers!
 Here is a a list of universities, in alphabetical order, we have compiled from the survey.</description>
