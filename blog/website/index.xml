      <description>Our servers crashed on Friday, March 1st due to technical problems. The Orange website was offline for several hours and Mac bundle was unaccessible until today.
We are still reviewing if our other services work. If you notice some problems, please ping us.
Stay tuned and fruitful downloading!</description>

      <description>We have added a simple contact form so that you can get in direct contact with us. Please do not misuse it (we will simply ignore you). Support and other general questions should be posted in our forum and for issues with Orange you should use our ticketing system to report them.</description>
