      <description>Ostrava is a city in the north-east of the Czech Republic and is the capital of the Moravian-Silesian Region. GIS Ostrava is a yearly conference organized by Jiří Horák and his team at the Technical University of Ostrava. University has a nice campus with a number of new developments. I have learned that this is the largest university campus in central and eastern Europe, as most of the universities, like mine, are city universities with buildings dispersed around the city.</description>
