This year Orange has been accepted into the [Google summer of Code](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011) program as a mentoring organization. It is one of [175 open-source organizations/projects/groups](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2011) which will this year mentor students while they will be working on those accepted open source projects.

We have prepared [a page on our Trac](http://orange.biolab.si/trac/intertrac/wiki%3AGSoC) with more information about the Google Summer of Code program, especially how the interested students should apply with their proposals. There is also a list of [of some ideas we are proposing](http://orange.biolab.si/trac/intertrac/wiki%3AGSoC/Ideas) for this year. Check out also [official project page](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2011/orange) for Orange.

Google Summer of Code is a [Google](http://www.google.com/)-sponsored program where Google stipends students working for a summer job on an open source projects from all around the world. Student is paid $5000 (and a t-shirt!) for approximately two months of work/contribution to the project. More about the program is available on [its homepage](http://socghop.appspot.com/).
