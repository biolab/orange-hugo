Orange 2.5a2 has been uploaded to [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Orange). It now includes basic support for multi-label classification (developed during the Google Summer of Code 2011), some new widget icons and documentation for basket format. Release is also tagged on our [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/biolab/orange/).
