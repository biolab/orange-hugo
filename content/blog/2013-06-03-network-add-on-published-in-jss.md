NetExplorer, a widget for network exploration, was in orange for over 5 years. Several network analysis widgets were added to Orange since, and we decided to move the entire network functionality to an [Orange Network add-on](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Orange-Network).

We recently published a paper [Interactive Network Exploration with Orange](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v53/i06) in the Journal of Statistical Software. We invite you to read the tutorial on network exploration. It is aimed for beginners in this topic, and includes detailed explanation with images.
