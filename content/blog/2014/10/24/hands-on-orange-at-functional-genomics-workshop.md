Last week we have co-organized a [Functional Genomics Workshop](http://biolab.github.io/functional-genomics-workshop/). At University of Ljubljana we have hosted an inspiring pack of scientists from the [Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research](http://tdccbr.med.utoronto.ca/) from Toronto. Part of the event was a hands-on workshop Data mining without programing, where we have used Orange to analyze data from systems biology. Data included a subset of Charlie Boone's famous yeast interaction data and data from chemical genomics. For the program, info about the speakers, and panckages and šmorn check out [workshop's newspaper](/images/2014/10/fg-times.pdf).

It is always a pleasure seeing a packed lecture room with all laptops running Orange. Attendees were assisted by members of the Biolab in Ljubljana. Hands-on program followed [a set of short lectures](/images/2014/10/fungen-workshop-notes.pdf) we have crafted for intended audience – biologists. Everything ran smoothly. At the end, we got excited enough to promise a data import wizard for all those that have problems annotating the data with feature type tags. The deadline: two weeks from the end of the workshop.
