At the invitation of dr. Mirjana Kljajić, we participated in the [32nd Bled eConference](http://bledconference.org/index.php/about/). The conference is one of the most important in the region on trends and technologies for electronic communication and this year a short workshop on Data Science with Orange was included in its programme.

We covered many topics, including data loading, visualization, construction of a predictive modeling workflow, exploration of decision trees, overfitting, model scoring and of course finally predicting with cross-validated model on a new data set. One of the classic exercises for such courses includes using the *Attrition - Train* and *Attrition - Predict* data sets from the Datasets widget and answering the following questions:

- Find one or two interesting variables in a Box Plot and describe what they show.
- Use all known models in Test and Score. Which one has the highest classification accuracy?
- Which three variables are the most important predictors for Logistic Regression?
- On a new data set, identify the person that is most likely to quit.
- What would be your recommendations to the HR department, considering the Nomogram?
