Middle of April marks the birthdate of our  new website - Pumice.si! The name is an abbreviation of the Slovenian expression - Lessons  with a pinch of artificial intelligence. 
It is a website full of news, blogs, and some information about its creators.

The most important aspect of the website are the activities that we have prepared for users (teachers or just curious people that have stumbled upon this site). In the tab Aktivnosti (or, activities, for those who donâ€™t speak Slovenian), you can find examples of teaching and learning materials, videos, data that ease users into work with the prepared materials, descriptions of lesson plans and descriptions on how those are connected with Slovenian elementary- or high-school curriculum.

Go ahead, have a look at it @pumice.si!
