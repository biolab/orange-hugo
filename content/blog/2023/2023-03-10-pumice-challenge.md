As part of the project "Pouk s ščepcem umetne inteligence" (Teaching with a Pinch of Artificial Intelligence) or simply just [Pumice](https://pumice.si/) (in Slovenian), we have prepared a challenge for students. We invited teachers from elementary and secondary schools that are already participating in the sister project [Artificial Intelligence for and by Teachers](https://tehnika.fnm.um.si/2023/03/14/aktivnosti-projekta-ai4t/) (AI4T). A total of 59 teachers from 32 different schools (15 elementary and 17 secondary) from all over Slovenia participated in the challenge.

We selected data about 100,000 Slovenes with the 200 most common surnames, their approximate locations on the map, and the corresponding municipalities. The challenge consisted of four parts, each containing a short video followed by a question that participants had to answer using the knowledge gained from watching the video.

For students, an educational video of around 6 minutes is acceptable, but the most effective length is between two to five minutes. Within this time frame, the students' concentration should not wane, so it made sense to divide the content into multiple parts. The videos are diverse enough to be interesting yet interconnected, creating a complete story.

The students tackled the challenges individually, in pairs, and sometimes in groups. Since we couldn't personally visit the schools where the challenges took place, we prepared materials for the teachers to assist them in case of any difficulties. The material is divided into four chapters corresponding to the four sets of videos and the posed questions. In these chapters, teachers familiarize themselves in more detail with the Orange widgets that were used in the video and learn the solution to the challenge question. Of course, there are multiple paths to the solution, but we present the one hinted at by the accompanying video.

Around 1,000 students from across Slovenia answered the posed questions and successfully completed the challenge. At the end of the successfully completed challenge, the participants received a T-shirt as a memento. We hope that the students will like the shirts and wear them willingly. Let them enthusiastically share how exploring data can be both fun and educational. Perhaps they will now embark on their own data exploration journeys.

We also expressed our gratitude to the teachers who bravely accepted the invitation to participate, carried out the challenge during their lessons, provided students with a new experience, and supported them in the actual implementation. We believe that they, too, have learned something new.

In conclusion, we once again congratulate all the participants on successfully completing the challenge. May your desire for exploration continue to accompany you.
