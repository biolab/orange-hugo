In the workflow, we show how to find and analyze variables related to survival. We start with variables ranked by univariate Cox regression analysis, where we can select the feature of interest. The Distribution widget shows its distribution and allows us to choose interactively a group of patients related to its values. We compare the survival of this group to all other patients in the Kaplan-Meier plot widget.
