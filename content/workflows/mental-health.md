The COVID-19 pandemic brought about many societal changes, including a serious effect on mental health. The Open Sourcing Mental Health 2021 survey measures attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace and examines the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers. The workflow presents how to uncover different types of tech employees based on their responses. The procedure is fully described in the [SAGE Ocean blog](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/mental-health-of-tech-employees-in-times-of-covid-19).
