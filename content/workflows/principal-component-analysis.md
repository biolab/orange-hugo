PCA transforms the data into a dataset with uncorrelated variables, also called principal components. PCA widget displays a graph (scree diagram) showing a degree of explained variance by best principal components and allows to interactively set the number of components to be included in the output dataset. In this workflow, we can observe the transformation in the Data Table and in Scatter Plot.
