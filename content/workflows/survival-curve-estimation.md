One of the primary objectives of survival analysis is to estimate the survival probability from observed survival times of different patients. The workflow plots the Kaplan-Meier approximation of the survival curve for the investigated population in the German breast cancer study group. The Kaplan-Meier plot is interactive; we select the longest-surviving patients and use Box Plot to analyze features that best characterize them.
