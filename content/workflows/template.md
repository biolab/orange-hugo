Load the data from scOrange single cell database, see the expression values in a spreadsheet, and use Louvain clustering to find cell groups. Visualize cell landscape in a t-SNE projection and inspect the results of clustering. Select a subset of cells in t-SNE to examine their type or gene expression statistics in the Box Plot. Find enriched Gene Ontology terms, which hint on cell types.
