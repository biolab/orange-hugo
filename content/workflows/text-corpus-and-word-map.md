This workflow shows how to extract the most common words from the documents and observe clusters of semantically similar words with Hierarchical Clustering. We select a group of words (connected to the traffic and roads) and use them to score documents according to selection with the Score Documents widget. The scores are visualized in the document map by the Self-Organizing Maps widget.
