The Extract Keywords widget can characterize a set of textual documents. In this workflow, we load the documents from the server, preprocess them and embed them in the vector space, and display a semantic document map in the t-SNE widget. In this widget, we can select a set of similar documents and then characterize them through keyword extraction. Extract keywords support different inference techniques, including TF-IDF and deep network-based characterization.
