The workflow loads the corpus from the [text repository on the server](http://file.biolab.si/text-semantics/data/predlogi-vladi-1k/). The repository contains documents with raw text and associated YAML files with meta-features. We here use some pre-processing and then display the most frequent words in a word cloud. This workflow could work on your repository: just change the URL in the Import Documents widget.
