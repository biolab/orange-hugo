Here&amp;rsquo;s a workflow that scores various classification techniques on a dataset from medicine. The central widget here is the one for testing and scoring, which is given the data and a set of learners, does cross-validation and scores predictive accuracy, and outputs the scores for further examination.</description></item><item><title>Cross Validation for Survival Models</title><link>/workflows/c-index-cross-validation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/workflows/c-index-cross-validation/</guid><description>Orange built-in methods for testing and scoring the predictive models now support survival-related models like Cox regression. Here we demonstrate cross-validation to estimate the concordance index for the Cox regression model trained on data instances from selected features.</description></item></channel></rss>
